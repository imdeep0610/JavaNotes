Final keyword
We cannot override a method which has final keword
for eg : public final add(){

          }
When a final method is called , Java compiler copied the bytecode directly with compile code of calling
method,eliminating the overhead associated with this method.

We cannot extends a final class, but when we declare a class as final emplicitly we make all its
method final
public final class Parent {

}
public class Child extends Parent{
 // This will show error
}


Late Binding : Dynamic Method Resolution
               It happen at runtime, after the compilation (the bytecode conversion stuff is done)
               and the program is running , that is when overriding is done. Hence it is called
               Late Binding


Early Binding : final method cannot be overriden is decided at compile time .This is called
                Early Binding


** Static method can be inherited but cannot be overriden becoz overiding depends on object
   and static method doesnt depend on object
   from whom obj we will call static method it will always execute the static method of parent class
